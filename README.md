# SQL-PROJECT-Online-Book-Store 
Business Problem
“Our online bookstore lacks clarity on inventory performance, customer behavior, and sales trends. This inhibits decisions on restocking, identifying popular genres/authors, and rewarding loyal customers.”

Project Goal
“Use SQL to uncover actionable insights from our Books, Customers, and Orders data—ultimately helping business teams drive smarter inventory, marketing strategies, and revenue growth.”

Key Insights (Highlights)
Which genres or authors drive the highest sales volume

Best-selling and most profitable books

Regions or customer segments generating the most revenue

Understocked or least performing inventory items

Tools & Process (concise, business-focused)
SQL — For querying operational tables (Books, Customers, Orders)
Joins & Aggregations — To compute totals, averages, groupings (e.g., books sold by genre/author; customer spend ranking)

Simple analytics — No complex models—just meaningful summaries that inform decisions

Business Impact
Optimize Inventory — Flag low-stock titles and high-demand genres for restocking
Improve Marketing — Target promotions based on best-selling genres/authors or high-value customer segments

Boost Revenue — Identify and retain high-spending customers; spotlight underperforming titles for bundle or discount strategies

Results Summary
“In just a few SQL queries, we identified top genres, high-spending customers, and revenue drivers—enabling the business to focus on restocking bestsellers, prioritizing customer retention, and enhancing promotional targeting.”
